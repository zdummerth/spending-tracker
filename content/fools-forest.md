### The Cabin

Michelle and Waylin walked through the forest; the sound of their footsteps dampened by the moist earth. The dense canopy allowed little light and warmth from the sun to seep through to the soft forest floor. Moisture filled the air from last night’s rain, unable to escape through the trees. Drops of water continued to fall with every gust of wind. Each time Michelle feared the rains would come back, but the glint of sun in the sky gave her hope for the moment.
Waylin’s teeth clattered together as he shook in his wet clothes with his arms wrapped around his chest. Michelle looked at him with worried eyes, she was just a cold but she couldn’t let him to know that. She had to be the one who comforted him, the one to tell him everything would be okay since it was her who got them into this, and she was responsible for him. Anything she could do to make it easier for him, she would, even if that was just putting on a strong face.
“Michelle, everything hurts. Can’t we stop and make a fire?” Asked Waylin.
“I wish we could, but everything is too wet.”
“But there is wood everywhere, I thought wood always burned.”
“I already told you we can’t do it, besides we don’t have anything to start the fire. Don’t worry we will find our way out soon,” said Michelle.
“You said that yesterday, and the day before. When are we actually going to get out?” He asked.
Michelle wished she had an answer for him, but she didn’t know. She wasn’t sure if they would ever get out, she had never been this deep in the forest before.
“Soon,” she said.
Waylin didn’t say anything.
In silence, the children continued to walk through the thick trees and dense foliage, Michelle didn’t have a better plan. If they kept walking, eventually they would find something, at least she hoped, but they hadn’t found anything for three days. Neither of them had eaten a single bite, her stomach ached with hunger pains. At least water was easy to find. With all the rain, there seemed to always be some pooled on a large leaf or running down the side of a rock formation. But they wouldn’t be able to last much longer without food.
At first, she couldn’t imagine eating one of the many small critters running along the forest floor, but they seemed more appetizing with each passing hour. Waylin would more than likely be ecstatic with the idea of eating a bug. Michelle was almost certain he had done it before for fun.
She thought of all the times she sat at the dinner table back at home. Food always seemed to be there and she never once considered the idea that she would go hungry. She used to be a scared of eating because it meant she would have to sit at the table with her mother. It wasn’t that she didn’t love her mother, but there was something there that kept them from being close, some unknown animosity existed between them. Now she missed her mother, and missed sitting at the table and eating with her. The thought almost brought tears to her eyes.
She looked over at Waylin, he was wet, cold, tired, and hungry. She wanted to do something to make him feel better but there was nothing. The only thing to do was to keep walking. Keep walking and hope they would find something soon.
Just at that moment, Michelle saw a shape forming through the trees. She squinted her eyes trying to make out what it was.
“Michelle look!” Shouted Waylin. “There’s something over there.” He ran.
“Waylin wait!” She shouted after him, but then she saw what it was. It looked like a house, but a house where no one had lived in a long time. She chased after her little brother as he made a beeline towards the decaying building. Waylin arrived and opened the door and ran inside.
She shouted again, but it was too late, Waylin was already inside. Michelle saw the house more clearly now. Thick forest vines had spread their greedy hands over most of the exterior. If it wasn’t for the box shape, it would have been difficult to tell the house apart from the rest of the forest. Part of the roof was missing along with part of one of the walls, but the vines had filled in most of the damage, making it appear whole. There was a brick chimney sticking out of the lush life forms surrounding the house.
The whole place made her uncomfortable, but she heard that voice in her head again. The same voice she had been hearing for the last day, the same voice that offered comfort when she needed it, the same voice that she had been listening to since she didn’t know who else to follow. Never in her life had she had to make decisions. Everything had been given to her, she only had to follow. The voice allowed her to continue to follow and not be responsible for the consequences for her decisions. She craved the voice, she longed for the direction it provided.
You will find rest in the shelter.
With the permission of the voice, Michelle entered the house. Waylin was already searching every corner of the place, opening cabinets, checking under a table, climbing a nearly empty bookshelf.
“Get down! You might tip it over.”
Waylin looked back towards her and reluctantly descended the bookshelf and continued exploring the abandoned cabin.
A fireplace was built into the wall on the right with scorched wood still inside. Beside the fireplace was a wooden cabinet that appeared to be in fairly good condition compared to the rest of the house. There was a single rocking chair facing the fireplace that looked as if it might fall apart at any second. Of course Waylin jumped on it and to Michelle’s surprise, it stayed intact as it rocked back and forth. In the middle of the room was a small table with another single chair pushed underneath. There was only a candle on the table.
To her left was a door, Michelle opened it. The other side used to be a bedroom, but the hole in the roof and the wall allowed the forest to grow inside. The room was damp and wet, covered in mud, and crawling with critters. There was a large bed pushed against the far wall and three smaller beds along the opposite wall. Michelle wondered who might have lived in a place like this. A large bug was quickly approaching her, she slammed the door shut and turned around. She couldn’t see any other doors besides the entrance and the one she just opened. Only the two rooms, the bedroom wasn’t an option, they would be staying in the living room.
“What’s in there?” Asked Waylin.
“It was the bedroom, but the roof is gone, we’ll have to sleep in here. Did you find anything?”
“Nothing cool, just a couple books, spoons, and some empty cans.”
They continued to check the house, inside one of the cabinets were two more cans. Michelle grabbed them both and shook off the dust.
“Michelle look,” said Waylin. “There’s logs in here, and a little box like you used to have.”
 Michelle looked over and saw him standing next to the open cabinet beside the fireplace. It was full of wood.
“Can we burn this?” He asked excitedly.
For the first time in three days, Michelle smiled. “I think so, and I might have found some food. I’ll try to get these cans open. Do you think you can start the fire?” She asked.
His eyes widened with excitement, then they narrowed with pretend coolness. “Yeah, I can do it.”
Michelle smiled again and looked for something to open the cans with, she found the spoons Waylin had mentioned. She grabbed one and tried to poke it through the top of the can with no success. Then stabbed the can over and over with the spoon with as much force as she could muster. After several attempts she managed to create a small hole on the outer edge of the lid. She pressed the tip of the spoon into the hole and pulled back trying to pry the lid off. Slowly the lid peeled from the rim of the can.
One half of the lid was perpendicular to the other half and she could see the contents of the can. Beans. They weren’t her favorite food, but at that moment they looked like the juiciest, most savory steak her father would cook for her on her birthday.
“Waylin,” she said excitedly. “I found food.”
She turned around and saw him facing the fireplace with his back slouched and head dipped towards the floor. There was no fire.
“I can’t do it,” said Waylin.
Michelle walked over.
“What did you do?” She asked.
“I took the rock and and that metal thing out of the box and hit them together like you used to do, but the logs didn’t light.”
Michelle smiled. “You won’t be able to light the log, you have to start with something smaller. I’ll show you how to do it in a second, eat first.” She handed him the can and the spoon. “It’s only beans but it should…”
He didn’t let her finish the sentence. The spoon fell to the floor as he grabbed the can with both hands and poured it down his throat.
Michelle laughed and grabbed the can from his hands. “Slow down, we don’t know how long we need this to last.”
“I thought you said we would be out of here soon.”
Michelle didn’t have an answer, but she didn’t want to lie to him either. “Hopefully we will, but we need to make sure we have enough food to get back home.”
Michelle picked up the spoon and noticed for the first time that there was no dust on the floor. Even at their home, if she didn’t sweep for a couple days the dust would start to build up. Here there was nothing.
“I’ll be right back, I’m going to find some water to clean this spoon. We don’t know the last time it was washed or who the last person to use it was.”
“Why? We don’t need a spoon.” He said, taking the can back and tipping the contents into his mouth.
Michelle laughed, “Slow down there.” She took the can back and put it on the table.
She walked back into the forest. The light seen through the thick canopy had a softer glow to it, the sun was setting. Not far from the house was a tree with the giant leaves that were useful for catching rainwater. She approached it and began washing the spoon.
You will be safe tonight, but you must leave at first light.
The words put fear into Michelle’s mind. What was wrong with staying at the house too long? It was far better than wandering the woods without food. But they would have to leave soon, there wasn’t any more food besides the two cans of beans and they had to find their way home. She shook off the words of the voice and finished washing the spoon.
On returning to the house, she saw that Waylin had finished the entire can of beans.
“Waylin!” She shouted. “I told you we needed to save that, it’s the only food we have.”
Waylin’s eyes dropped to the floor.
 “Sorry ‘Chelle.” He said.
Michelle immediately regretted using such a harsh tone. She could hardly blame him for eating all of it, her hunger tempted her as well.
“It’s okay, we just need to be careful. Why don’t you go outside before it gets dark and rinse out that can. Once it’s clean, fill it up with water and we can use it as a cup.”
“Okay,” he said.
Michelle took the freshly cleaned spoon and started stabbing the lid of the second can. Eventually she got it open in the same way as the first. But she used her manners and ate with a spoon, but she ate it heartily. Halfway through the can, she forced herself to stop. She couldn’t do the same thing she just yelled at Waylin for, and they really did need to save it.
Waylin returned with a can full of water. “Here you go ‘Chelle, wash those beans down with some highly refreshing liquid thunder.”
Michelle laughed out loud, “That doesn’t make any sense. How about I show you how to make that fire now?”
“Yeah! Let’s do it.”
Michelle walked towards the cabinet with the logs. On the bottom shelf were smaller sticks and some dried pine needles. In the small box that Waylin had found was dried grass and thin fibers used for tinder.
“You see, you can’t start with the big stuff, you have to start small and work your way up. The spark isn’t strong enough to light the log, it has to find something smaller it can handle. When the spark catches something it can handle, then you can put something bigger on, and eventually you will be able to burn the log.”
She took all the burnt logs out of the fireplace. Waylin watched excitedly.
“Now the spark isn’t even strong enough to light the twigs, it still needs to start with something smaller.”
She placed the dried grass and thin fibers on the floor, she picked up up the flint and steel. Waylin watched carefully as she took a piece of some dark cloth and pressed it against the rock with her thumb.
“You hold it like this, and then you hit the rock with the steel until the spark catches the char cloth. Here you try.”
She handed him the flint and the char cloth and placed his hands in the right position.
“Now hit it,” she said.
He struck the steel against the flint and there was a spark, but the cloth didn’t light. His eyes widened in excitement.
“There you go, now keep trying until the cloth catches,” said Michelle.
Waylin struck the rock a couple more times and on the third strike the cloth lit, and there was a tiny red ember. Michelle couldn’t remember the last time she had seen her brother so happy. His face was full of joy and pride as he looked up towards her.
“Now what?” He asked.
Michelle already had the dried grass and thin fibers in her hands.
“Place the cloth on top of this,” she said.
Waylin took the cloth off the rock and quickly put it on the tinder. Michelle wrapped the tinder over the tiny ember and blew softly. Smoke began to filter out.
“You have to blow on it to get it going, but not too hard or else you might blow it out, you have to do it softly.”
Michelle continued to blow on the tinder until it burst into flame. Waylin made an audible cry of excitement, and Michelle placed the burning tinder into the fire place.
“Like I said before, we have to start small, the fire still isn’t ready for the log yet, if we give the flame more than it can handle, it will suffocate and die.”
She took the pine needles and put them on the flame as it increased in size. She kept adding the needles until she thought the fire was ready.
“Now that the flame is stronger, we can add a little bit more, but we can’t put the log on just yet. Now we can use the twigs. Do you want to put them on?”
“Uh, that’s okay, you can do it,” he answered.
Michelle was surprised to hear the fear in his voice, she thought he would jump at the idea of throwing the twigs in, but something about the fire scared him. She didn’t push the subject.
Michelle added the small twigs as the flame increased in size and warmth. Once she thought the fire was strong enough, she grabbed one of the logs.
“Now that the worked our way up, the flame is ready for the log, but if we aren’t careful, we still might smother the fire. We need to give it space to breathe.”
Michelle took had three logs altogether and leaned them against one another to form a teepee over the flame.
“Now once these logs get going, the fire will be ready to handle anything. Fire is very powerful, but just like everything else, it’s weak in the beginning and you have to be gentle,” said Michelle.
 Waylin stared into the flame, mesmerized. “Who taught you all this?” He asked.
“Father did, he used to teach me a lot of things.” There was a brief silence before Michelle changed the subject.
“Give this a few minutes to burn and we can put on another one. Now take off your clothes.”
“What?” Asked Waylin. “Why do you want me to get naked? I don’t want you to see my willy.”
Michelle laughed out loud. “I don’t want to see your willy either, but we need to dry our clothes, we’re still soaked and now we have a fire. You’ll be much warmer and feel much better when you're dry. And you don’t have to take off everything, you can leave your undies on.”
“Okay,” said Waylin, looking at Michelle through the corner of his eye. “If you say so.”
He lifted his shirt over his head, still suspicious of Michelle, and threw it on the rocking chair. He untied his shoes, shook them off his feet, undid the waist of his pants and was about to drop them.
“Turn around ‘Chelle, you don’t want to see this.”
“Whatever you say.” Michelle turned around and heard him place his pants on the chair as well. Then she lifted her dress over her head.
“‘Chelle! What are you doing? I don’t want to see your bits either.”
“You're not seeing any ‘bits’, I’m still covered,” she said standing there in her underwear. “And where did you hear these words? Bits and Willies?”
“You’re a gross person ‘Chelle.” He said as he sat on the floor, his back facing her and arms crossed.
Michelle chuckled to herself.
She placed her dress alongside Waylin’s clothes on the rocking chair and pulled it closer to the fire. She added another log to the fire and embraced the warmth. Waylin, still upset over seeing his sister in her underwear, sat off to the side.
Michelle wanted to lay her head down but didn’t want to sleep on the hard, wooden floor. She saw the windows still had curtains, and went to each one and ripped them down. She laid one down along the floor near the fire, folded several others into a pillow, and threw another log into the fire. She settled into the makeshift bed and pulled another curtain over her body for a blanket. Waylin still wouldn’t face her, but she caught him looking over his shoulder.
“There’s plenty of room for the both of us,” she said.
He didn’t say a word.
“Suit yourself.”
After a few minutes, he couldn’t help himself anymore. He crawled next to her under the curtains and pulled them up to his neck.
“Are we ever going to see her again? And don’t tell me ‘of course’ if you don’t know,” said Waylin.
“I hope so,” she said, leaning over and kissing her little brother on the forehead.
“Will you tell me a story about dad?” He asked.
“Why do you want to hear about that?”
“Because I never really knew him. I like to hear stories about him, they make me feel like I actually remember him. Tell me about when he fought off the entire pack of wolves.”
“He didn’t fight off an entire pack, it was just one. I think the rest of the pack were close, I could hear them, but I never saw them.”
“Don’t start there, start from the beginning,” said Waylin.
“Okay, okay. It happened right after you were born, so I was six years old. You were so little, you could barely even open your eyes. All you did was eat, sleep, and poop.”
“Hey! I was a baby, I couldn’t help it.” Said Waylin.
Michelle chuckled. “If you want me to tell the story, I’m going to tell it how I want.”
“Fine, keep going.”
“You were so cute though.”
Waylin sighed.
“I just wanted to hold you and play with you all the time, but you weren’t old enough to play with me. I always bothered mom to just let me spend some time with you, but I think she got aggravated at my nagging so she told me to find a present for you to distract me. She said if I found you a really good present, I could hold you some more.
“I was so excited, I wanted to get you the best present I could find. I knew there were these rocks in the woods that were a gorgeous color of green, and the sun sparkled off them. You could almost see through them if you looked hard enough. I thought they were the most beautiful rocks in the world, and I wanted to give them to the most bewwwwtiful little baby in the world.”
Waylin snorted.
“So I ran out of the house to find them for you. I saw dad outside chopping wood, and he warned me not to go too far, but I didn’t listen, I wanted the rocks for you. I lied to him and said I wouldn’t, but the rocks were far into the woods.
“I went into the forest, alone, and headed towards where I remembered the rocks were. I had been there before with dad, and I thought I could find them. I was running, trying to get there and back as soon as I could, but I tripped over something and sprained my ankle. I tried to get up, but it hurt too much to walk.
“I should have called for dad, but I didn’t want him to find me that far in the woods and know that I lied to him. I sat there trying to figure out what to do. I wanted to keep going and get the rocks for you, but my ankle hurt so much when I stood that I screamed. I wasn’t even able to walk.
“Then I heard the howling. It sounded far away, but it terrified me, and I screamed again. Then I covered my mouth hoping that the wolves didn’t hear. I sat there trying to figure out what to do, but I was too afraid. A few minutes later I saw it, the large gray and black wolf. I remember its paws as it silently walked circles around me. I was so scared that I couldn’t even shout for help, but I remember wondering how an animal so big could be so quiet. I never even heard it until I saw it standing twenty feet away.
“It continued to circle me, determining if I was a threat or not.”
Waylin interrupted, “Why would a wolf be afraid of you? You were just a little girl, you couldn’t have done anything to it.”
“I know I couldn’t hurt the wolf, but it didn’t know that, at first. It quickly realized that I couldn’t do anything, and it got closer and closer, growling and showing its teeth. I closed my eyes as tears were streaming down my face. I thought I would die right there, I remember thinking that I wouldn’t be able to give you your present.”
“Sure you did. I bet you were just peeing your pants,” said Waylin.
“Anyway,” Michelle continued. “I was sitting there with my eyes closed, ankle throbbing in pain, expecting the wolf to attack at any second. Then I heard a shout. I opened my eyes and saw the wolf looking at something to my left. I turned my head and there was dad, screaming at the top of his lungs with his arms spread wide.
“The wolf turned and faced dad. I had no doubt that he would be able to save me, he was the toughest person I had ever known.
“I saw him bend over and pick up a stone. He reached back and threw it as hard as he could towards the wolf, hitting it square in the face and making it yelp. It was the most beautiful sound I have ever heard. I thought it would have ran away after that, but it seemed more angry than hurt. It bent its front legs and growled, looking ready to charge towards dad. But dad beat him to it, charging as he pulled a large knife out of his belt. The wolf hesitated, not expecting the move. Mid stride, dad bent down and grabbed another rock. With a hop step, he chucked it at the wolf, another headshot. It had been hit twice and now there was a full grown man charging, screaming at loud as he could. The wolf wanted no part of it and took off in the other direction. Dad saved me.
“He carried me all the way home and never told mom about the wolf. He only said that I twisted my ankle while looking for a present. He was just happy that I was okay, and he knew that mom would never be able to forgive me for lying about going too far in the woods.”
“I wish knew him,” said Waylin. “He sounds so cool in all the stories.”
“You did know him, you just weren’t old enough to remember.”
“That’s the same thing as not knowing him.” Waylin paused, taking a breath. “How did he die? Mom never told me.”
“That’s a story for another time.”
“But ‘Chelle.”
“Another time. Now it’s time for bed.”
“Ugh, fine.” He turned on his side and was asleep in a few minutes.
Michelle stayed awake. Thoughts of her father filled her mind; she missed him. If he was with her, she wouldn’t be afraid. He was always brave and never looked scared, even when face to face with the wolf. If only she could be as brave as him, but he made it look as easy as chopping wood. She hoped Waylin thought she was brave, she didn’t want him to be scared, she felt scared enough for the both of them.
The fire crackled softly next to the children. It was a peaceful sound that brought some comfort to Michelle. Waylin was facing away from her, his breathing steady and deep.
Michelle’s thoughts kept her from falling asleep. Carefully, she slid out from under the covers and looked around the cabin for something that could take her mind off her father.
The bookshelf.
She listened to the voice and walked towards the bookshelf. There were only a couple books scattered along the shelves. She picked up the first one she saw and flipped through the pages. It was written in some unknown language, but there letters felt familiar somehow. She put it down and picked up another book, when she opened it a thick, folded piece of paper fell to the floor.
Michelle reached down and picked it up. Looking at it, she knew this is what the voice wanted her to find. What was so important about it? Why did the voice want her to find it? The questions resonated with Michelle as she held it in her hand.
She unfolded the old, faded paper with the fire crackling behind her. It was a map. She could tell it was a map of a forest, small trees were drawn throughout, but she didn’t know how to read it. There were many markings she didn’t understand. A tree larger than all the others was drawn on the right side, and strange geometric patterns filled certain parts. There were circles, triangles, and squares all intersecting at different angles to form a symbol Michelle didn’t recognize. There was something that resembled a house next to one of these symbols. Could this be the cabin they were in? It must be a map of the forest she was in, it could lead them home.
The map gave Michelle a sense of hope but there was also fear; she didn’t want to look at the symbols but she felt drawn to them.
Find the tree, but avoid the symbols. They will only bring darkness.
The voice sounded afraid. For the first time, Michelle didn’t want to listen. She wanted to find one of the symbols on the map, she needed to find it. The voice hadn’t brought her home yet, maybe it didn’t even know how to get home, maybe it was time to make her own decisions. Tomorrow, she would use the map and find one of these symbols.
You cannot. It will not help you home.
“I can, and I will,” whispered Michelle, feeling confident in herself. The voice didn't reply.
She walked to her dress hanging on the rocking chair and placed the map inside the pocket. After placing another log in the fire, she lay next to Waylin and pulled the curtains up to her neck. Now she felt peace, sleep came easily.
