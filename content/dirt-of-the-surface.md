Jesen, Zarick, Bree, and Jolie escape from the underground and walk through the tunnel. In the tunnel sitting around the fire, Jolie tells them how Willem saved them all from Jale, the evil king of the underground. They keep climbing through the tunnel for hours and hours until they finally see something that none of them have ever witnessed before. Rain. The sound of the water falling from the sky scared them at first and they were all afraid to step out into it. But of them all, jolie was the bravest. She stepped out into the pouring rain and began to fly through the sky. She returned laughing giddily and said how beautiful it was and how fresh the air is up there. There is no smell of shit or piss, only the moisture in the air.
Now Bree is intrigued and begins to play with the rain with her ability. She makes the rain fall upward, and then back down. Then she makes a bubble that keeps all the rain out. The children walk in their bubble through the mud. Then it all falls apart and they get soaked.
Zarick looks at Bree a little fearfully.
Jesen asks what it is.
Bree is scared that there might be some creature with powerful enough abilities to cause the rain. She’s worried that this thing is the reason jesens family kept everyone hidden in the underground because of these deadly creatures.

“If something wanted us dead, don’t you think it would have happened by now?” Said Jesen. “If it was really that dangerous, I think it would do a little more than just get us wet.”

Bree isn’t convinced.
They go back to the entrance of the tunnel to get out of the rain and figure out what to do.
Water is the first step, so Jesen has Bree shake a hole for them and then filter the water into it. She tells them the water is clean which she knows from her ability.

During the night, they try to decide what they need to do.
It’s much darker now than it was when they first arrived. None of them know if it will get any brighter.
Zarick tells them that there’s no point to going out because they can’t see anything, and they can’t use fire for light with the rain.
Someone suggests using the bubble trick and use the fire under that.
Zarick says that they still wouldn’t be able to see outside the bubble.
He then says that he read the orbs from the lighters mimic the sun, and since the orbs are remade everyday, maybe the sun is recreated everyday.
Jolie asks if there’s another evil creature that is responsible for creating the sun. No one really has an answer.
Jolie then wonders if everything on the surface is the same as it was in the underground, just on a bigger scale.
Someone suggests that they go back into the underground.
They decide that they will wait until after they all sleep, and if there is still no light, then they will risk going out to find food.
